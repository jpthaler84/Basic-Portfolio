				<p>
					Marshmallow jelly souff-- Oh, hi there. I didn't see you come in. As you can see from my name at the top there, my name is Jordan. Things that are pleasing to me include hockey, metal, video games, and my beautiful wife and daughter.

					I'm having a really fun time learning about web development for the most part. My least favorite part so far was somehow deleting the HTML I wrote for this assignment and having to start all the way over! Good times...
