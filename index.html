			<p>
			Marshmallow jelly souff-- Oh, hey there. Didn't see you. As you can see above, my name is Jordan. I enjoy video games, death metal, hockey (Go Stars!), and spending time with my wife and daughter
			</p>

			<p>
			I'm very much looking forward to learning all I can about web development over the course of the next 6 months. I want to do what I love, make money doing it, and constantly be challenged. And to own a Tesla Model S.
